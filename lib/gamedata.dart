Nasa is determined to make the journey for first human on mars as safe as possible. Nasa has determined 3 fatal challenges that needs to be solved. 
1st one being the atmosphere. The atmosphere on the mars is very thin. And consiquently it has very little oxygen.
The 2nd challenge is radiation. The magnetic field of earth protects us from the solar radiation. Unfortunately mars does not have that type of protection
And the 3rd challenge is the toxic soil which is rich in sulpher.
Your objective is to genetcally alter shuvos DNA to complete the mission successfully.

The fur you see is a thick layer of long, colorless guard hairs that shed water quickly after a swim. They are stiff and transparent and hollow. In the arctic sunlight, the hairs act like mirrors and reflect white light, which acts as camouflage against the snow so the bears are not seen by their prey.  Polar bear skin is actually black, so that it can absorb the invisible warm infrared rays of the sun and the bearâ€™s own body heat, both of which are reflected back by the guard hairs.',
